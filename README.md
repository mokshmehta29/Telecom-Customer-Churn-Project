# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Project
Project for the Course - BA with R at UT Dallas

Data analysis on customer churn is crucial to understanding and addressing the issue of churn in any business. This study uses data on customer behavior and characteristics to analyze customer churn in a specific industry.

Customer churn analysis and prediction in the telecom industry is a problem nowadays since the sector must examine customer behavior to identify those who will cancel their subscription. Because acquiring new customers costs more than keeping existing ones, machine learning techniques and algorithms are crucial for businesses in today's commercial environment. 


In the telecom industry, customer churn can significantly impact a company's revenue and profitability. In this study, we analyze customer churn in the telecom industry using customer behavior and characteristics data. We use machine learning algorithms to identify factors associated with a higher likelihood of churn and develop strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

In this project, we create and compare classification models using machine learning techniques for forecasting customer churn, such as lazy learning, random forest, and logistic regression. 
Our goal is to find a data-driven solution that would enable us to lower churn rates, which will boost customer happiness and business income.
